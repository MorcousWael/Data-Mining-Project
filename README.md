# Data-Mining-Project
College project for Data Mining Subject.
## Project description:
It is required to make use of the technologies studied during the lab by applying techniques 
which meet the requirement for your project's data. 
The project makes 20 degrees from total course degrees. Ensure that you applied all required 
points in the project description. For each point in project description, you should apply all 
studied models in lab according to your project idea ex: preprocessing techniques , 
algorithms.. and so on.
You can know your project from this link
All projects Ideas from here
Deliverables:
## There are two milestones :
### 1- The first delivery Documentation will be comprehensive for preprocessing techniques , 
detect outliers from data and visualize data assessment for correlation relations between 
variables (potential plots for data representation)
### 2- The final project Documentation that contains:
a. Your Project name <br/>
b. Your names <br/>
c. represent the applied tools for each point in description with screenshots for the 
result of tools (tables , graphs ,……), the used Libraries and the accuracy for each 
Model <br/>
## There are some points you should try to apply it into your project :
1- applying extra techniques in preprocessing to improve accuracy  <br/>
2- apply different techniques for splitting data into training and testing  <br/>
3- Use different testing Methods  <br/>
4- Applying extra Models into your data for classification or Clustering (The application of 
new models other than the models studied in the laptop, but with a basic condition that the 
team is fully aware of the way these models work)  <br/>
5- Try different Visualization graphs for each Model  <br/>
6- Search for getting another available data which can apply it into the model <br/>
